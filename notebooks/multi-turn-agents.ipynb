    "# Evaluating Multi-Turn Conversations with Simulated Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore a more effective approach to evaluating multi-turn customer support agents. Traditional evaluation methods that use a single input-output pair are insufficient for agents that need to adapt their tool usage as conversations evolve. Instead, we'll implement a simulation-based approach where an LLM evaluates our agent against specific success criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem with Traditional Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional evaluation methods for customer support agents often use a dataset where:\n",
    "- Input: Customer ticket/query\n",
    "- Output: Expected sequence of tool calls\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has significant limitations:\n",
    "1. It assumes a fixed, predetermined path to resolution\n",
    "2. It doesn't account for new information discovered during the conversation\n",
    "3. It focuses on the exact sequence of tools rather than achieving the desired outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Better Approach: Simulation-Based Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of predicting exact tool sequences, we'll define success criteria that focus on what the agent must accomplish, regardless of the specific path taken. For example:"

    "Traditional evaluation methods that rely on fixed input-output pairs are insufficient for multi-turn conversational agents. By simulating complete conversations and evaluating against outcome-based criteria, we can better assess an agent's ability to handle real-world customer support scenarios.\n",

    "This approach allows us to focus on what matters—successfully resolving customer issues—rather than following a predetermined sequence of steps. As your agent evolves, you can refine your success criteria to ensure it meets your business needs while providing excellent customer service."
