    "# Build & Evaluate a RAG Application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we demonstrate how to build a RAG application and apply a systematic evaluation framework using LangWatch. We'll focus on data-driven approaches to measure and improve retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, RAG evaluation emphasizes the quality of the generated answers. However, this approach has major drawbacks: itâ€™s slow (you must wait for the LLM to generate responses), expensive (LLM usage costs add up quickly), and subjective (evaluating answer quality can be inconsistent). Instead, we focus on evaluating retrieval, which is fast, cheap, and objective. "

You barely have users. But you do have access to your own corpus. And with a bit of prompting, you can start generating useful data from it. If you already have a dataset, you can use it directly. If not, you can generate a synthetic dataset using LangWatchâ€™s `data_simulator` library. For retrieval evaluation, your dataset should contain queries and the expected document IDs that should be retrieved. In this example, I downloaded four research papers (GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4) and will use `data_simulator` to generate queries based on them."

On\\nWinograd GPT-3 achieves 88.3%, 89.7%, and 88.6% in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, showing no clear\\nin-context learning but in all cases achieving strong results just a few points below state-of-the-art and estimated human\\nperformance. We note that contamination analysis found some Winograd schemas in the training data but this appears\\nto have only a small effect on results (see Section 4).\\nOn the more dif\\ufb01cult Winogrande dataset, we do \\ufb01nd gains to in-context learning: GPT-3 achieves 70.2% in the\\nzero-shot setting, 73.2% in the one-shot setting, and 77.7% in the few-shot setting.

Phrase-level or sentence-level embeddings, which can be trained using an unlabeled\\ncorpus, have been used to encode text into suitable vector representations for various target tasks [28,\\n32, 1, 36, 22, 12, 56, 31].\\nUnsupervised pre-training Unsupervised pre-training is a special case of semi-supervised learning\\nwhere the goal is to \\ufb01nd a good initialization point instead of modifying the supervised learning\\nobjective. Early works explored the use of the technique in image classi\\ufb01cation [ 20, 49, 63] and\\nregression tasks [3]. Subsequent research [15] demonstrated that pre-training acts as a regularization\\nscheme, enabling better generalization in deep neural networks. In recent work, the method has\\nbeen used to help train deep neural networks on various tasks like image classi\\ufb01cation [69], speech\\nrecognition [68], entity disambiguation [17] and machine translation [48].\"\n",

First, it is unclear what type of optimization objectives are most effective at learning\\ntext representations that are useful for transfer. Recent research has looked at various objectives\\nsuch as language modeling [44], machine translation [38], and discourse coherence [22], with each\\nmethod outperforming the others on different tasks. 1 Second, there is no consensus on the most\\neffective way to transfer these learned representations to the target task.

Figure 1\\nprovides an overview of all the tasks and datasets.\\nNatural Language Inference The task of natural language inference (NLI), also known as recog-\\nnizing textual entailment, involves reading a pair of sentences and judging the relationship between\\nthem from one of entailment, contradiction or neutral. Although there has been a lot of\\nrecent interest [58, 35, 44], the task remains challenging due to the presence of a wide variety of\\nphenomena like lexical entailment, coreference, and lexical and syntactic ambiguity.

Note that this setting differs slightly from the WSC task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, which\\nis presented as binary classi\\ufb01cation and requires entity extraction to convert to the form described in this section. On\\nWinograd GPT-3 achieves 88.3%, 89.7%, and 88.6% in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, showing no clear\\nin-context learning but in all cases achieving strong results just a few points below state-of-the-art and estimated human\\nperformance. We note that contamination analysis found some Winograd schemas in the training data but this appears\\nto have only a small effect on results (see Section 4).\\nOn the more dif\\ufb01cult Winogrande dataset, we do \\ufb01nd gains to in-context learning: GPT-3 achieves 70.2% in the\\nzero-shot setting, 73.2% in the one-shot setting, and 77.7% in the few-shot setting.

Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly de\\ufb01ning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a\\nspectrum of how much task-speci\\ufb01c data they tend to rely on. Speci\\ufb01cally, we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration):\"\n",

The\\nprimary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive\\nmodel-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that\\nhave very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably\\npredict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1, 000\\u00d7 \\u2013\\n10, 000\\u00d7 less compute.\\n3.1 Loss Prediction\\nThe final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power\"\n",

Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the\\nzero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art\\nrelative to \\ufb01ne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot pro\\ufb01ciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-\\ufb02y reasoning,\"\n",

However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3\\u2019s\\nperformance on downstream tasks, especially in the \\ufb01ne-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3\\u2019s scale with these\"\n",

This allowed us to make\\npredictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways)\\nthat were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models [1, 37, 38]: it is not fully\\nreliable (e.g. can suffer from \\u201challucinations\\u201d), has a limited context window, and does not learn\\n\\u2217Please cite this work as \\u201cOpenAI (2023)\\\".

Such models are an important area of study as they have the\\npotential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization,\\nand machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in\\nrecent years [1\\u201334].\\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate\\nnatural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities\\nin such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In\\nthese evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers.\"\n",

Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly de\\ufb01ning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a\\nspectrum of how much task-speci\\ufb01c data they tend to rely on. Speci\\ufb01cally, we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration):\"\n",

As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in\\nrecent years [1\\u201334].\\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate\\nnatural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities\\nin such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans.

As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in\\nrecent years [1\\u201334].\\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate\\nnatural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities\\nin such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans.

We omit\\nthe 4 Wikipedia-related tasks in that work because they are entirely contained in our training data, and we also omit the\\none-billion word benchmark due to a high fraction of the dataset being contained in our training set. PTB escapes these\\nissues due to predating the modern internet. Our largest model sets a new SOTA on PTB by a substantial margin of 15\\npoints, achieving a perplexity of 20.50. Note that since PTB is a traditional language modeling dataset it does not have\\na clear separation of examples to de\\ufb01ne one-shot or few-shot evaluation around, so we measure only zero-shot.\\n3.1.2 LAMBADA\\nThe LAMBADA dataset [PKL+16] tests the modeling of long-range dependencies in text \\u2013 the model is asked to\"\n",

As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in\\nrecent years [1\\u201334].\\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate\\nnatural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities\\nin such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans.

Existing techniques involve\\na combination of making task-speci\\ufb01c changes to the model architecture [ 43, 44], using intricate\\nlearning schemes [21] and adding auxiliary learning objectives [50]. These uncertainties have made\\nit dif\\ufb01cult to develop effective semi-supervised learning approaches for language processing.\"\n",

Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context.

While less capable than\\nhumans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance\\non various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated\\nbar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-\\nbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training\\nalignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and\\nadherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing\\ninfrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide\\nrange of scales.

    "Based on our evaluation results, we can now make data-driven decisions about our RAG system. We found that for our usecase, a small embedding model actually provided better performance than a large embedding model. Since there's many different parameters you can change to optimize your RAG pipeline, you want to run a lot more experiments with different configurations, i.e. adding a reranker or using a different retrieval method, like hybrid search. \n",

    "Remember that these results are specific to our test dataset - your evaluations may yield different insights. In the next notebook, we'll explore evaluating fine-tuning approaches to embedding models (and why you (almost) always should)."
