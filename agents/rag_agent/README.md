# Systematically Improving RAG Agents

This repository contains a series of Google Colab notebooks that guide users through the process of systematically improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agents. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of RAG development and optimization, providing both theoretical background and practical implementations.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval systems with generative AI to create more accurate, relevant, and grounded outputs. This project takes you through a methodical approach to building, evaluating, and optimizing RAG systems, from establishing baselines to implementing advanced techniques.

## Notebook Structure

### 1. Getting Started (`1_getting_started.ipynb`)
- Environment setup and dependency installation
- Introduction to RAG concepts and architecture
- Quick demonstration of a basic RAG implementation
- Walkthrough of the project structure

### 2. Core Logic (`2_core_logic.ipynb`)
- Detailed RAG architecture breakdown
- Modular component implementation:
  - Document processing and chunking
  - Embedding generation
  - Vector storage and retrieval
  - Generation with context
- Creating a flexible, configurable RAG pipeline

### 3. Evaluations (`3_evaluations.ipynb`)
- Defining comprehensive evaluation metrics
  - Retrieval accuracy (Precision, Recall, MRR)
  - Answer relevance and correctness
  - Hallucination detection
  - Response latency
- Implementation of automated evaluation pipelines
- Visualization of system performance
- Baseline performance benchmarking

### 4. Ablation Study (`4_ablation_study.ipynb`)
- Systematic comparative experiments across configurations:
  - Chunking strategies (fixed-size, semantic, hierarchical)
  - Embedding models (comparison of various models)
  - Retrieval techniques (BM25, dense, hybrid approaches)
  - Reranking methods (cross-encoders, fusion techniques)
  - Query processing strategies (expansion, reformulation)
  - LLM prompt engineering variations
- Performance analysis and insights
- Best practices and recommendations based on experimental results

### 5. UX Demo (`5_ux_demo.ipynb`)
