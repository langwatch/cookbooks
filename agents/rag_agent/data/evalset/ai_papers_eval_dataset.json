    "answer": "Table 4 provides a comparison of model performance metrics across different methods based on the GLUE benchmark. The metrics compared include Matthews correlation (mc), Accuracy (acc), F1 score (F1), and Pearson correlation (pc) for various tasks such as CoLA, SST2, MRPC, STSB, and QQP. The results indicate that the Finetuned Transformer LM (our model) achieves the highest Matthews correlation (45.4) and performs competitively in accuracy (91.3) and F1 scores (82.3 for MRPC and 70.3 for QQP), outperforming single-task and multi-task BiLSTM models, as well as other methods listed. Overall, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 12 evaluated datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes."
