# AI Agents from Scratch

Modern LLMs are incredibly powerful, but on their own they lack memory, tool use, and the ability to interact with the world. To build real-world applicationsâ€”like automated customer supportâ€”you need agents: systems that reason, take actions, and make decisions over time.

This notebook series walks through the process of building **agentic AI systems from scratch**, without relying on Agent Frameworks. By the end, you'll have a fully functioning multi-agent customer support system that retrieves company knowledge, reasons over customer data, and even simulates actions like refunds and cancellations.

We start simpleâ€”with a single prompted LLMâ€”and incrementally layer in tools and logic. Each notebook introduces new agentic capabilities, culminating in a system that plans, retrieves, computes, and acts like a real support agent.

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure and evaluate AI agents step-by-step
- How to build your own tool calling + planner loop
- How to simulate a real-world customer support system (even without backend integrations)
